Python exam project

The dataset reports the temperature recorded in major cities around the world since 1750. Using this data,
 the project will need to provide an effective graphical visualization of the change in temperatures over time, 
 highlighting the cities where the largest temperature ranges were recorded during different historical periods.
 For visualization of the data on a map, see geopandas.
The program will also suggest, depending on the period considered, the best route to follow for a traveler
 who intends to move from Beijing to Los Angeles by moving step by step to the warmest city among the 3 closest to him.

Phase 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning.
1. Download dataset
2. Data Cleaning:

3. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Convert date columns to a standardized format.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

5. Conduct initial statistical analysis to understand the overall trends.
6. Visualize temperature changes over time globally.

Phase 2: City Temperature Analysis
1. Identifying Cities with Largest Temperature Ranges:

2. Calculate temperature ranges for each city during different historical periods.
3. Identify cities with the largest temperature variations.
4. Visualization Tools:
5. Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for line plots and bar charts to showcase temperature ranges.
Use Geopandas to create maps highlighting cities with significant temperature variations.

Phase 3: Travel Recommendations
1. Optimal Route Calculation:

2. Implement an algorithm to find the warmest city among the three closest to the traveler's current location.
3. Consider different historical periods for temperature analysis.
4. Visualization of Travel Recommendations:

Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the optimal travel route on a world map.
Display temperature trends along the suggested route.

Phase 4: User Interface (Optional)
1. Development of a Simple User Interface:
2. Create a basic interface to allow users to input their current location and desired destination.
3. Display historical temperature trends and recommended travel routes.
Phase 5: Documentation and Reporting
Code Documentation:

Document code thoroughly, including comments and explanations for each function and module.
