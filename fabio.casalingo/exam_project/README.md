The Travel Planner is a Python program designed to assist in planning and visualizing travel routes between cities. It utilizes geographical data from a dataset of world cities, allowing users to find the closest cities, calculate the shortest path between two cities, explore an eastward path, and visualize the journey on 2D and 3D maps.

Features:

Closest Cities: Find the closest cities to a given city based on geographical distance.
Shortest Path: Calculate the shortest path between two cities using a customizable algorithm.
Eastward Path: Explore an eastward path from a starting city until a certain condition is met.
2D Map Visualization: Visualize the travel route on a 2D map with markers and connecting lines.
3D Globe Visualization: Experience the travel path on a 3D globe with markers and lines connecting the cities.
