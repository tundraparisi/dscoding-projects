The Aim of this Project is to compare two data classification algorithm by classifying a dataset of zoo-animals into 7 different classes by considering their different traits (properties/ features). 
The project is cretated as part of a Lab Project for Data Science Course.

The project demonstrates the use of github for version control, usage of pandas, and numpy for data manipulation and computing. Further, matplotlib is used  for data visualization.

The project also demonstrates the use of two Machine Learning algorithms for data-classification.
