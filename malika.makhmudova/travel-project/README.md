Travel

Consider the dataset describing some of the world's major cities. Assume that it is always possible to travel from each city to the 3 nearest cities and that such travel takes 2 hours to the nearest city, 4 hours to the second nearest city, and 8 hours to the third nearest city. In addition, the trip takes an additional 2 hours if the destination city is in another country than the starting city and an additional 2 hours if the destination city has more than 200,000 inhabitants.Starting in London and always traveling east, is it possible to travel around the world by returning to London in 80 days? How long does this take at a minimum?
