# AC Milan's fan's comments analysis

By Nikita Olefir

## Goal of the project

I intend to analyze how the fans of AC Milan reacted on the results of two games with PSG in the UEFA Champions Leauge 2023/2024. Milan lost 0-3 in the first game, but won 2-1 in the next one.

The goal is to answer the following research questions:

1) Are Milan's fans  happier when their favourite team wins than are sadder when it loses?
2) Do fans of Milan tend to 'forgive' the coach of the Milan (Stefano Pioli) after victories
3) Do they ten to blame/praise the team in general or they address individual players + coach?


## Data

To get the information about the fans' reactions, I collect comments from Reddit's threads on the respective topics. To do so, I use Reddit (get yourself familiar with the [documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)). 

I collect comments from two threads:

1) [Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/17gb1xz/match_thread_psg_vs_milan_champions_league_202324/) when Milan lost to PSG 0-3.
2) [Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACMilan/comments/17pzwvv/scoreboard_paris_saintgermain_ac_milan/) when Milan won PSG 2-1.
