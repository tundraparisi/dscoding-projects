    "Hello! âœ¨ The Quiz âœ¨ project is a simple project powered by IMDb movie data. The goal is very simple: Besides getting the best possible grade ğŸ‘€, the goal is to create a quiz of 10 movie-related questions. With each correct answer, players earn points according to the difficiulty level they chose. Throughout this notebook, I'll explain how I made that possible. \n",

    "This is the core function in the `Quiz` class. This function initiates the quiz game by prompting the player for a name and selecting a difficulty level. It generates and presents 10 questions from the different types we mentioned above. The player selects answers using multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D). The function keeps track of the player's score based on the correctness of their answers and displays the score for each question. After the game, it presents the total score, the player's performance in a histogram compared to other players, and saves the updated scores to the json file.\n"
