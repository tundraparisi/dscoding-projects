1. Quiz
The purpose of the project is to automatically create multiple-choice film-related quizzes, exploiting data from IMDb. Each quiz must consist of one question and four possible answers, only one of which must be correct. The program that generates the quizzes must also implement a criterion to generate the possible answers proportional to the difficulty of the desired quiz. The program must also allow a human player to answer the quiz and must measure his/her performance with an overall score that takes into account the difficulty of each individual question. IMDb data can be acquired through specific APIs (such as Cinemagoer) or existing datasets, such as IMDb Dataset.
